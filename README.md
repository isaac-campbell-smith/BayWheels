# BayWheels
An exploratory data analysis of the last 2 years of Lyft's bike sharing service, Bay Wheels, in California's Bay Area

Over the course of the next week I'll be looking at the trip data for this service and see what kind of things I can learn. My working hypothesis about this service, and my assumption about bike sharing services generally, is that most people are using them for the novelty and not commuting or other functional purposes. I am prepared to be wrong!
