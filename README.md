Welcome to my exploratory data analysis of the last 2 years of Lyft's Bay Area CA bike sharing service, Bay Wheels! This repo was prepared during as first capstone project as a student at Galvanize Seattle. Shall we dive in?

This was my first experience working locally with a huge data set and my gosh was it a pain. The data was fairly clean which was a huge relief, but there were some column-wise calculations needing to be performed, which, over 5 million data points across 27 csv files, was not easy. My computer fan was the true hero throughout the week. Here's what the initial data looked like:

Over the course of the next week I'll be looking at the trip data for this service and see what kind of things I can learn. My working hypothesis about this service, and my assumption about bike sharing services generally, is that most people are using them for the novelty and not commuting or other functional purposes. I am prepared to be wrong!
